    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/notes HTTP/1.1
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 游릭 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: 3. The browser sends additional requests for styles and JavaScript files
    Note right of browser: 4. The browser fetches the notes data with the newly added entry

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/data.json HTTP/1.1
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 游릭 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    deactivate server
```

## Task 2: Single Page App - Homepage Loading

### Steps:
1. User opens the SPA homepage in their browser.
2. Browser sends a `GET` request for the main HTML file.
3. Server responds with the HTML file.
4. Browser sends additional `GET` requests for the required JavaScript and CSS files.
5. Server responds with the requested files.
6. JavaScript code runs in the browser, fetching existing notes as JSON.
7. Browser dynamically renders the notes on the page without additional page loads.

    activate server
    server-->>browser: 游릭 HTTP/1.1 200 OK (CSS)
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/data.json HTTP/1.1
    activate server
